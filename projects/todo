From project part 2:
You should have a list of different characters, and be able to zoom into see the details of them.  We discussed in class how all this should be implemented in this deliverable. 

Finish part 3:
Add all the images to your website (Don't break copyright laws). All images need to look professional, no stretching...
Update all text to no longer be lorem ipsum and have appropriate text
Add a color scheme, This must be tasetful, appropriate, match a logo (if you have one). I would run this by friends and get feedback.
Everything has to scroll flawlessly, no images should exceed the space, everything should look good on all resolutions. You may need multiple media queries.
