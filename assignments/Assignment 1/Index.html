        <h2>True Tea</h2>    
        <p>Tea is the second most consumed beverage, the first being water. But what exactly is tea? Tea technically refers to only drinks brewed from <i>Camellia sinensis</i>. The different teas, such as green and black, are from processing the leaves and buds in different ways. Below I have a table that shows the different types of true teas and how they are processed: </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Type of Tea</th>
                <th>How it's processed</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Green Tea</th>
                <th>The leaves of the tea plant that becomes green tea are withered and then immediantely dried. Then they are either fired or steamed. Generally speaking, Chinese style green tea is pan-fired or roasted while Japanese green tea is steamed.</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Black Tea</th>
                <th>Leaves are harvested and then immediantely withered and rolled. Then, they are spread out to fully oxidize. Once fully brown, they are fired to stop additonal oxidation and thus flavor change.</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Oolong Tea</th>
                <th>This tea is partially oxidized and thus is sort of combination of green and black tea in terms of taste. This also means that this tea has a great diverity of flavors from its different varieties.</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Pu-erh Tea</th>
                <th>Technically a subtype of green tea, pu-erh is either raw or aged. When aged, its typically aged between 10 to 15 years during which it is oxidized again.</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>White Tea</th>
                <th>The least processed type of tea, white tea is made using only the baby tea leaves. It only undergoes natural drying.</th>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Many types of teas are called herbal teas. However, these drinks are not technically tea. Instead, they are actually tisanes. Tisanes are infusions of all sorts of plants into water, such as fruits, herbs, and spices. At the end of this paragraph will be a link to a website that gives a more detailed explaination of the differences between tisanes and tea:</p>
